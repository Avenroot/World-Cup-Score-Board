Here you will find all the code and resouces that I completed for the coding task.  I did my best to follow good OO design and follow the SOLID principles while keeping the code clean and simple.  I followed Test-Driven Development by creating unit tests for my class structures and running those tests as I developed my classes to ensure they work according to the requirements.

I satisfied the code requirement by implementing methods for starting a new game, updating the score, finishing a game and returning a summary of games (in the required order).  I tested all these requirements using 10 unit tests.

Finally, I created a simple UI implementation of the class libraries to show a summary of the games shown in the requirements documentation.  

Assumptions/notes:

1. Mexico 0 - Canada 5 I interperted as Mexico being the home team and Canada being the away team.  I did this for all the games in the examples given.
2. In the UI implementation I added some flag graphics to make thing visibly more appealing and make the scoreboard clearer. 
3. I have included a exe file which you can run to see the UI application in action.  You will find the application in the \exe folder.
4. I have included screenshots in the /media/screenshots folder of my testing results and the UI application I built.
